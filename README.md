# [swarm.city Terminal](https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-terminal/blob/master/README.md) Github


The Swarm City Terminal is the starting point of the user journey in Swarm City. The Swarm City Terminal will be the main entry screen into the Swarm City ecosystem and will be the browser for the hashtags ( starting with #ridesharing ). It provides the Swarm City citizens the possibility to create and manage a basic profile and exchange SWT tokens in a wallet.

> ## Create New User / Restore a backup file


There are several ways to create a wallet. 
When creating a new user it is stored locally on your device. If you have ARC tokens that you want to convert to SWR tokens you will need a smal amount of eth (.1 eth) on the wallet before you can complete the swap.


Yes, convert my tokens | Nope, don't have any | Restore a backup file

> ## Restore a backup file

To load a previously deleted account that was created, backed up with IPFS, and deleted from the this device through the Terminal.


enter IPFS-hash > restore


<br>


> ## Create a Profile

Click on the profile picture or username to access the profile view. On the profile view, you see a profile avatar, username, and public wallet address. You also see a button to make backup, delete this user, and log out.

Personalize your account by changing the profile picture and username. The user can upload a profile picture or take the picture with the camera in his device. The image can be cropped before saving. 


<br>


> ## Make a backup


Next to the avatar and username, there is a warning sign (!). It will be there as long as the user hasnâ€™t made a backup. Clicking on it or on the avatar/username takes the user to the profile view with instructions to make a backup. The user can download the json file and can choose to store it on the device or on the [IPFS distributed web](https://ipfs.io).
