# The Terminal - Swarm City's First Release


The [Swarm City Terminal](https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-terminal/blob/master/README.md) is the starting point of the user journey in Swarm City. The [Terminal](https://github.com/swarmcity/dev.swarm.city/blob/master/README.md) is the main entry screen into the Swarm City ecosystem and will lead you to [Boardwalk](https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-terminal/blob/master/README.md), the browser for the hashtags, starting with #ridesharing. It provides the Swarm City users the ability to create and manage a basic profile, exchange Arcade City tokens (ARC) for Swarm City Tokens (SWT), as well as sending and receiving SWT from any other wallet.

> ## Create new user / Restore a backup file


There are several ways to create a new Swarm City wallet. When creating a new wallet it is stored locally on your device, no central database. The password you choose will be used to encrypt your wallet on your device.

Restore a backup file can only be used to retrieve a previously deleted SWT wallet that was created, backed up with IPFS, and deleted from the device through the Terminal. 


<br>


Create new user > Yes, convert my tokens | Create new user > Nope, don't have any | Restore a backup file
---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------
**from an ARC wallet:** as a json > choose file > enter password of ARC wallet > creating new wallet | create a password > repeat password > create a backup > download and/or ipfs | restore a backup file > enter IPFS-hash > restore
**from an ARC wallet:** as a print pdf > enter private key > create password > repeat password > creating new wallet |
**from ANY wallet:** an external wallet > enter private key > create password > repeat password > creating new wallet |

> ## Create a Profile

Click on the profile avatar or username to access the profile view. On the profile view, you see a profile avatar, username, and public wallet address. You also see a button to make backup, delete this user, and log out.

Personalize your account by changing the profile picture and username. The user can upload a profile picture or take the picture with the camera in his device. The image can be cropped before saving.  

Once you have created a profile you can log in and out at will. Upon re-entry to the Swarm City Terminal, your wallet can be loaded by entering your password only, unless you delete the user. In which case, you can follow the steps to cretae a new user and load a new wallet.

> ## Exchange ARC for SWT


[Original whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9RSMdR2vWssV2JJX0t6dmN6SUk/view) - [SWT token whitepaper](https://github.com/swarmcity/sc-token/blob/master/token-exchange-miniwhitepaper.md) - [Swarm City Token Contract (SWT)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xb9e7f8568e08d5659f5d29c4997173d84cdf2607)

**If you have ARC tokens that you want to convert to SWT you will need a small amount of ether to cover gas fees, approximately 0.1 eth in the wallet holding the ARC tokens, before you can complete the swap. This will be more than enough to cover several transactions**

> ## Send SWT / Receive SWT

Users can send to and recieve SWT from any other user by sharing their shortcode or public address.

**Never share your password, IPFS-hash or private key**


<br>


Send SWT | Receive SWT
--------------- | ------------------
click on SWT balance > send SWT > enter amount > enter shortcode or public address of receiver | click on SWT balance > shortcode > copy and paste to the sender before the code expires

> ## Create a backup / Delete this user / Logout


The Swarm City app is fully decentralized so there is no central party storing your account information. When a user is removed from a device it can only be recovered by a backup that you have created for yourself. The backup with your password will give you permanent and complete control of your tokens.

Next to the avatar and username there is a warning sign (!). It will be there as long as the user hasnâ€™t made a backup. Clicking on it or on the avatar/username takes the user to the profile view with instructions to make a backup. 

The user can download the json file and can choose to store it on the device or on the [IPFS distributed web](https://ipfs.io).

Select delete this user to switch between wallets. At this time, the Terminal can load contents from only one wallet at a time. When deleting a user the contents of the wallet will remain intact. Any IPFS-hash or backup download created will retain it's merit and can be used to reload the account after deletion.

**Be sure to store your public address, private key, password, and IPFS-hash in a safe place.**
